### Low-01 Incorrect comment -  Fee should be between 1/6 and 1/2 of the growth in sqrt(k)

**Instances(1)**

ThrusterPair.sol allows fee/yieldCut to be adjusted between 1/6 and 1/2 (15% to 50%) of growth in sqrt(k). And the yieldCut is calculated in `_mintYieldCut()`. 

However, `_mintYieldCut()` has incorrect comments which state that the fee is always 1/6th. 

```solidity
//thruster-protocol/thruster-cfmm/contracts/ThrusterPair.sol
      //@audit : Incorrect comment - fee should be between 1/6 th and 1/2 of the growth in sqrt(k)
|>    // if yieldCut is on, mint liquidity equivalent to 1/6th of the growth in sqrt(k)
    function _mintYieldCut(
        uint112 _reserve0,
        uint112 _reserve1
    ) private returns (bool yieldCutOn) {
```

Recommendations:
Change the comment to reflect the range `1/6 and 1/2`. 

### Low-02 Unnecessary inheritance of IThrusterERC20 in TrusterPair.sol

**Instances(1)**

Based on readme, a design decision is made to flatten ERC20 function implementations in TrustedPair.sol. As a result, ERC20 methods are included in both TrusterPair.sol and ITrustedPair.sol. 

There is no need to add to TrustedPair.sol's inheritance chain with addition of IThrusterERC20.sol which is a subset of ITrusterPair.sol

```solidity
//thruster-protocol/thruster-cfmm/contracts/ThrusterPair.sol

contract ThrusterPair is IThrusterPair, IThrusterERC20, ThrusterYield {
...
//thruster-protocol/thruster-cfmm/interfaces/IThrusterPair.sol
interface IThrusterPair {
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value);
...
    function name() external pure returns (string memory);
    function symbol() external pure returns (string memory);
    function decimals() external pure returns (uint8);
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256);
...
```
(https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-thruster/blob/3896779349f90a44b46f2646094cb34fffd7f66e/thruster-protocol/thruster-cfmm/contracts/ThrusterPair.sol#L15)

Recommendations:
Remove IThrusterERC20 inheritance.

### Low-03 ThrusterPair may have an outdated manager address due to a vulnerable manager update mechanism. 
**Instances(1)**

A manager role in ThrusterPair(inheriting ThrusterYield) can claim Blast rewards generated from the contract. This manager address should be the same as `yieldTo` address in ThrusterPoolFactory.sol.

For each pool/pair, the manager role can be updated in `ThrusterYield::setManager()` manually by the current manager/`yieldTo` address. Each pair contract will have its isolated `manager` address in storage. 
However, this is not an efficient mechanism to sync the manager address across all deployed pools/pairs with ThrusterFactory. Here's one challenging scenario:

Too many pairs to update for the manager or too costly. Due to pool deployment being permissionless, there could be too many pairs for all the manager addresses to be updated efficiently and affordably over time. When not all pair contracts are updated at the same time, some pair contracts will have an outdated manager address. 

In addition, if the outdated manager address is compromised, the old manager address can also potentially hijack the Blast rewards of those pair contracts. 

```solidity
//thruster-protocol/thruster-cfmm/contracts/ThrusterYield.sol

    function setManager(address _manager) external onlyManager {
        manager = _manager;
    }

```
The protocol calling each pair contracts to update the `manager` address is not an ideal update mechanism. It opens up risk for outdated manager addresses to persist in some pair contracts, and also compromised old manager accounts to hijack pair Blast rewards.

Recommendations:
In ThrusterYield.sol, instead of storing an isolated `manager` address, in `onlyManager()`, simply call ThrusterFactory for the most current `yieldTo` address.

### Low-04 `claimPrizesForRound()` doesn't satisfy check-effect-interaction patterns
**Instances(1)**

In ThrusterTreasure.sol, `claimPrizesForRound()` is a public function that allows users/winners to claim prizes. But this function doesn't satisfy the `check-effect-interaction` pattern and might become vulnerable to reentrancy if the external interactions allow callback functions.

Notably, `claimPrizesForRound()` will first call external interactions `_claimPrize()` which involves external token transfers in a for-loop. And it only updates users round info `entered[msg.sender][roundToClaim]` at the end of the function call. This means, if user can re-enter `claimPrizesForRound()`, user's `entered[msg.sender][roundToClaim]` will not be cleared, potentially allowing users to `_claimPrize()` multiple times.

```solidity
//thruster-protocol/thruster-treasure/contracts/ThrusterTreasure.sol
    function claimPrizesForRound(uint256 roundToClaim) external {
...
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < maxPrizeCount_; i++) {
                         //@audit interactions
...            |>        _claimPrize(prize, msg.sender, winningTicket);
...
    }
          //@audit effects
|>        entered[msg.sender][roundToClaim] = Round(0, 0, roundToClaim); // Clear user's tickets for the round
        emit CheckedPrizesForRound(msg.sender, roundToClaim);
    }
```
(https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-thruster/blob/3896779349f90a44b46f2646094cb34fffd7f66e/thruster-protocol/thruster-treasure/contracts/ThrusterTreasure.sol#L114-L118)

Recommendations:
Update `entered[msg.sender][roundToClaim]` before calling `_claimPrize()`.


### Low-05 Unnecessary code in ThrusterTreasure::requestRandomNumberMany and ThrusterTreasure::requestRandomNumber
**Instances(2)**

In ThrusterTreasure.sol, both `requestRandomNumberMany()` and `requestRandomNumber()` contains a line of unnecessary code `requestedRandomNumber[sequenceNumber] = msg.sender;`.

Due to `requestRandomNumberMany()` and `requestRandomNumber()` only allows owner to call and request random number from Etropy, `msg.sender` will always be owner. Also `sequenceNumber` is a return intermediate value from Etropy, and will only be meaningful when paired with the corresponding random numbers and commitment values that are generated off-chain. So storing a single `sequenceNumber` with always the same owner address only costs more gas with no meaningful impact.

In addition, the storage mapping `requestedRandomNumber[sequenceNumber]` can also be removed since it is never read on-chain and will not be helpful for the off-chain process either because it doesn't show the pairing of `userCommitment` and `sequenceNumber`. Simply `emit RandomNumberRequest` will be sufficient for the off-chain process. 

```solidity
//thruster-protocol/thruster-treasure/contracts/ThrusterTreasure.sol

    function requestRandomNumber(
        bytes32 userCommitment
    ) external payable onlyOwner returns (uint64) {
...
        //@audit unnecessary, can remove. 
|>      requestedRandomNumber[sequenceNumber] = msg.sender;
        emit RandomNumberRequest(sequenceNumber, userCommitment);
       
...
  }

    function requestRandomNumberMany(
        bytes32[] calldata userCommitments
    ) external payable onlyOwner returns (uint64[] memory seqNums) {
...
            //@audit unnecessary, can remove. 
|>          requestedRandomNumber[sequenceNumber] = msg.sender;
            emit RandomNumberRequest(sequenceNumber, userCommitments[i]);
...
```

Recommendations:
Remove `requestedRandomNumber[sequenceNumber] = msg.sender;`

### Low-06 Unnecessary implementations for ETH rewards - Pools canâ€™t receive ETH in balance and will never be eligible for ETH rewards. 
**Instances(2)**

Three contracts have implementations for ETH Blast rewards but these contracts don't implement `receive()` or `payable` functions to ever receive eth after deployment. Contracts that do not hold ETH will not be eligible for ETH blast rewards. So no need for these ETH blast reward implementations in these contracts.

```solidity
//thruster-protocol/thruster-clmm/contracts/ThrusterPool.sol
constructor() {
        int24 _tickSpacing;
        BLAST.configureClaimableGas();
        //@audit Pool will not in normal circumstance be able to receive ETH in balance and will not be eligible for ETH rewards.
|>      BLAST.configureClaimableYield();
        USDB.configure(YieldMode.CLAIMABLE);
        WETHB.configure(YieldMode.CLAIMABLE);
...
```
(https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-thruster/blob/3896779349f90a44b46f2646094cb34fffd7f66e/thruster-protocol/thruster-clmm/contracts/ThrusterPool.sol#L130)
```solidity
//thruster-protocol/thruster-cfmm/contracts/ThrusterYield.sol
    constructor(address _manager) public {
        BLAST.configureClaimableGas();
|>      BLAST.configureClaimableYield();
        USDB.configure(IERC20Rebasing.YieldMode.CLAIMABLE);
        WETHB.configure(IERC20Rebasing.YieldMode.CLAIMABLE);
        manager = _manager;
    }
...
```
(https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-thruster/blob/3896779349f90a44b46f2646094cb34fffd7f66e/thruster-protocol/thruster-cfmm/contracts/ThrusterYield.sol#L26)

Recommendations:
Remove both the ETH rewards configuration and the claiming code for ETH rewards for contracts not able to receive ETH.

### Low-07 A user can withdraw prizes immediately after winning tickets drawn, bypassing the intended 'next draw period' delay stated by Doc

In Thruster [Doc](https://docs.thruster.finance/docs/products/thruster-treasure/overview), there is a mention of the timing of winner claim prizes which states `then a user will be subsequently prompted to claim their prize once the next draw period starts`. 

There are no on-chain mechanisms to ensure that winners only claim prizes at the start of `the next draw period`. In fact, a winner can claim their prize immediately after the owner draws winning tickets through `setWinningTickets()`. 

A winner can view the winning ticket result through querying `mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => uint256[])) public winningTickets;` for `currentRound` and prizeIndexes from 0 to maximum. Then a winner can directly call `claimPrizesForRound()` to claim prizes immediately. 

If the intention is to unify a prize-winning window for a given round (as stated in Doc), then add a check in `claimPrizesForRound()` to ensure a minimal delay timestamp.

```solidity
//

    function claimPrizesForRound(uint256 roundToClaim) external {
        //@audit note: as long as MAX_ROUNT_TIME(30 days) hasn't passed, user can claim prizes as soon as the owner set `winningTickets` for the round. No delay in claiming is enforced.
        require(
            roundStart[roundToClaim] + MAX_ROUND_TIME >= block.timestamp,
            "ICT"
        );
        require(winningTickets[roundToClaim][0].length > 0, "NWT");
...
```
(https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-02-thruster/blob/3896779349f90a44b46f2646094cb34fffd7f66e/thruster-protocol/thruster-treasure/contracts/ThrusterTreasure.sol#L103-L104)

Recommendations:
If the intention is to unify a prize-winning window for a given round to 'next draw period starts'(as stated in doc), then add a check in `claimPrizesForRound()` to ensure a minimal delay timestamp.
